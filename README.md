# [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

```
The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead, or "populated" or "unpopulated". Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.

Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.

Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.

Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seed—births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

# 🦀🕸️ `wasm-pack-template`

A template for kick starting a Rust and WebAssembly project using
[`wasm-pack`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack).

[**📚 Read this template tutorial! 📚**][template-docs]

This template is designed for compiling Rust libraries into WebAssembly and
publishing the resulting package to NPM.

Be sure to check out [other `wasm-pack` tutorials online][tutorials] for other
templates and usages of `wasm-pack`.

## 🚴 Usage

### 🐑 Use `cargo generate` to Clone this Template

[Learn more about `cargo generate` here.](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate)

```
cargo generate --git https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-pack-template.git --name my-project
cd my-project
```

### 🛠️ Build with `wasm-pack build`

```
wasm-pack build
```

### 🔬 Test in Headless Browsers with `wasm-pack test`

```
wasm-pack test --headless --firefox
```

### 🎁 Publish to NPM with `wasm-pack publish`

```
wasm-pack publish
```

## 🔋 Batteries Included

- [`wasm-bindgen`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen) for communicating
  between WebAssembly and JavaScript.
- [`console_error_panic_hook`](https://github.com/rustwasm/console_error_panic_hook)
  for logging panic messages to the developer console.
- [`wee_alloc`](https://github.com/rustwasm/wee_alloc), an allocator optimized
  for small code size.
